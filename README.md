My one of the best projects. DegustoVR is a website that gets products straight from Stripe, so everything you see is what's available. I added a way for you to sign up using your details or Google Account. Once you're logged in, you can place orders. But even if you're not logged in, you can still explore all the cool stuff I made. With Stripe Elements, you can pay for everything on the site without going anywhere else. The cart system is handy too â€“ you can add and remove stuff while you shop. ðŸ›’ðŸ’³
